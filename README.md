# Archivium

Archivium is a worldbuilding tool, allowing you to organize everything about your world in one place. 
It's designed for creators who want to keep track of all the details that make their worlds unique — from characters and histories to maps and cultures.
Whether you're developing a novel, designing a game, or just exploring new ideas, 
Archivium offers a flexible space to collect, connect, and expand on your world’s elements at your own pace.
You can work privately or collaborate with others, bringing your imaginative landscapes and stories to life.

# Features

### Items & Universes

The basic components of Archivium are Items and Universes. Items contain information about specific things within your world, such as individual characters, locations, organizations, etc. Universes allow you to group items that belong to the same world or story together.

### Markdown Descriptions

Items may have a text body that supports standard markdown syntax (with some exceptions — we're working on it!), as well as some extra syntax to make designing the layout of your item's page or linking to another item easier.

### Galleries

Any number of image links can be attached to an item, where they will be displayed in a **Gallery** tab.

### Lineages

An item can list other items as its Parents or Children. This information is displayed in the **Lineage** tab and is generally used to construct simple family trees for **Character** items. (Full family tree explorer coming soon!)

### Custom Data Tabs

An item can have any number of tabs containing custom key-value data. The markdown body can also pull information from these tabs, making them useful for data storage as well as display.

### Home Page

The home page lets you stay up to date on what other collaborators have been doing in universes you contribute to, as well as bringing old and possibly stale items to your attention for review.
